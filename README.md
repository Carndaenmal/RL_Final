Description
-------------------------------------------------------

Generative modelling is focused on matching a data distribution and reinforcement learning is focused on finding the optimal policy by maximizing a reward for successful tasks. 
We explore the application of GFlowNets on learning acyclic causal structural models with approaches more oriented to reinforcement learning strategies. Especially from [DynGFN](https://github.com/lazaratan/dyn-gfn) and [Max Ent RL](https://github.com/tristandeleu/gfn-maxent-rl).
